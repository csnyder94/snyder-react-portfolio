      <p>Hello, my name is Christopher Snyder, and I'm a Full Stack Web Developer based in Western North Carolina. After working in emergency services for the last ten years, I've decided to pursue a career in web development. I am currently enrolled in UNC Charlotte's Coding Bootcamp, where I am learning various web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, MySQL, and MongoDB.

I specialize in building dynamic web applications with responsive design and user-friendly interfaces. In my portfolio, you will find a showcase of my work, including projects that utilize both SQL and NoSQL databases such as MySQL and MongoDB.

One of my recent projects involved building a blood donation website using Node.js, and MongoDB. My group and I created a RESTful API with Express and integrated it with a Handlebars front-end, allowing users to create profiles, update profile information, and schedule a blood donation in real-time. Another project I worked on was a web-based employee management system that used a MySQL database to store and manage data on employees within a company.

I am passionate about learning new technologies and staying up-to-date with the latest trends in web development. If you're looking for a full-stack web developer with experience in building robust, scalable web applications, feel free to contact me.</p>
